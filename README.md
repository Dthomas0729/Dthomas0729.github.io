#Hangman Cinemas

This is a hangman game that uses only movie titles as the words you need to spell. 

##Description

Hangman Cinemas was my first project during my time as a student with General Assembly. I was tasked with using vanilla Javascript and css to build and deploy any game of my choice. I have a deep affection for movies and wanted to expand upon my very first solo project as a self taught developer. see here --->
