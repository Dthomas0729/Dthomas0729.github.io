# Hangman Cinemas

This is a hangman game that uses only movie titles. Play with one player or two and earn cash for correctly guessed letters! Also play with your favorite  movie genre.

## Description

Hangman Cinemas was my first project during my time as a student with General Assembly. I was tasked with using vanilla Javascript and css to build and deploy any game of my choice. I have a deep affection for movies and wanted to expand upon my very first solo project as a self taught developer. **see here ---> https://github.com/Dthomas0729/HANGMAN---Amazing-Movies**
